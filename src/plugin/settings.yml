  EngineMode: 0
  ## Update Radius, Higher this value is, higher will be the cpu usage.
  UpdateRadius: 1
  ## FakeCaves, set Enabled to true to generate fake caves in way to prevent xray texture pack and cavefinders.
  FakeCaves:
    ## It **might** cause fps drops on the client side and also a little bit more of cpu on the server si
    Enabled: false
    ## Intensity, the intensity of caves to generate, higher this value is, more fake caves you will have
    Intensity: 50

Darkness:

  Enabled: false
  ## LightUpdate, if true, if you place a light souce (listed on UpdateOn) an update will be cast
  LightUpdate: false
  ## BrightRadius, the radius around the light to be updated, Higher this value is, higher will be the cpu usage.
  BrightRadius: 8
  ## UpdateOn, the block id that will cast the update when placed
  UpdateOn: 50, 51, 89

  ## PlayerMoveEvent, if true, player move event will be used, this might be very laggy
  PlayerMoveEvent: false
  
Threads:
  ## Enabled, if true, the obfuscation process will be made in a separate thread, if you can't modify your craftbukkit.jar and want to use threads you may wanna check this out.
  ## If you have too much players online and are speriencing slow chunk seding, increase the amount of thread, but never put it higher than your number of cpu cores
  ## This option should not change the cpu usage, but it will require more memory. This is not compatible with the server-side module.
  Enabled: false
  ## Amount of threads to obfuscate chunks
  Amount: 2
  ## PlayerThread, if true, each player will have his own processing thread
  PlayerThread: false
